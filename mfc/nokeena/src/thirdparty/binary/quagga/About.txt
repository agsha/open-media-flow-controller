Steps to create the binary.
The source was downloaded from http://www.quagga.net/download.php
The commands to build the binaries are:

tar zxvf /data/archive/thirdparty/src/quagga/quagga-0.99.18.tar.gz 
cd quagga-0.99.18
./configure --disable-ripd --disable-ripngd --disable-ospfd --disable-ospf6d --enable-vtysh --enable-user=admin --enable-group=root
make
mkdir /tmp/quagga-install
make install DESTDIR=/tmp/quagga-install
cd /tmp/quagga-install
echo 'password test' > usr/local/etc/zebra.conf
echo 'password test' > usr/local/etc/bgpd.conf
echo 'username root nopassword' > usr/local/etc/vtysh.conf
mkdir copy
cp \
  usr/local/bin/vtysh \
  usr/local/sbin/bgpd \
  usr/local/sbin/watchquagga \
  usr/local/sbin/zebra \
  usr/local/lib/libzebra.so.0.0.0 \
  usr/local/etc/bgpd.conf \
  usr/local/etc/vtysh.conf \
  usr/local/etc/zebra.conf \
  copy

# These symlinks need to be made as well.
#   usr/local/lib/libzebra.so -> libzebra.so.0.0.0
#   usr/local/lib/libzebra.so.0 -> libzebra.so.0.0.0

For the build on CentOS 6.3, the files that were copied in the above step
have been checked into the "6" subdir.
