GPAC rev 0.4.5 was released December 2008 and is the current version as of May 2010.

The source to libgpac and MP4Box is the MFC source tree as
  dist/thirdparty-src/gpac/gpac-0.4.5.tgz
We are not making any changes to the source, just doing a plain build (by hand),
and putting the single binary file "MP4Box" and library "libgpac.so" in
our tree so that the binary gets placed in the package under /opt/nkn/bin and
the library libgpac.so needs to be in /usr/lib

GPAC is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License. (LGPL)
It was originally downloaded from http://gpac.sourceforge.net/home_download.php
The original download was a "0.4.5" version which is not downloadable as such anymore.
The file gpac-0.4.5.tgz was created from that download.

The home page is in different place now: https://gpac.wp.mines-telecom.fr
The latest source is currently available from sourceforge Subverison:
  svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/gpac/code/trunk/gpac
  svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/gpac/code/trunk/gpac_extra_libs

Steps to create the binary & library
1. Extract the source from gpac-0.4.5.tgz
2. Cd into the source directory and build the software:
   cd gpac-0.4.5/gpac
   sh configure --disable-opengl
   make lib
   make apps
3. The files we need are:
     bin/gcc/MP4Box
     bin/gcc/libgpac.so

These two files that were built on CentOS 6.3 have been put into the
source tree here
  nokeena/src/thirdparty/binary/gpac/6/MP4Box
  nokeena/src/thirdparty/binary/gpac/6/libgpac.so
