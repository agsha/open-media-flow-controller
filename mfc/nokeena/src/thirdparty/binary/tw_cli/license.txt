LICENSE AGREEMENT. BY USING THIS SOFTWARE, YOU, THE END-USER, AGREE TO THE LICENSE TERMS BELOW. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, 
YOU MAY NOT USE THE SOFTWARE.

1. Grant of License
Conditioned upon compliance with the terms and conditions of this Software License Agreement ("Agreement"), LSI Corporation ("LSI") 
grants you, the original licensee, a nonexclusive and nontransferable limited license to use (including installation on multiple 
computers) for your internal business purposes the Software and the Documentation, ("Permitted Use"). 

2. License Conditions; Confidentiality 
The Software and Documentation are confidential information of LSI and its licensors. Except as expressly permitted herein, you may 
not disclose or give copies of the Software or Documentation to others and you may not let others gain access to the same. You may 
not post the Software or Documentation, or otherwise make available, in any form, on the Internet or in other public places or media. 
You may not modify, adapt, translate, rent, lease, loan, distribute or resell for profit, or create derivative works based upon, the 
Software or Documentation or any part of thereof, but you may transfer the original media containing the Software and Documentation 
on a one-time basis provided you retain no copies of the Software and Documentation and the recipient assumes all of the terms of 
this Agreement. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to derive source code from the Software 
except to the extent allowed by law. 

3. No Warranty 
LSI grants a limited warranty only to the original licensee, that the Software will perform substantially in accordance with the 
Documentation prepared by LSI for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of receipt by the original licensee. LSI's entire 
liability and the licensee's exclusive remedy for breach of the limited warranty above shall be, at LSI's sole option and discretion, 
either: (a) the repair or replacement of the non-conforming Software which is returned to LSI and determined by LSI to be 
non-conforming, or (b) the return of the price the original licensee paid solely for the Software. This limited warranty is void if 
the non-conformance of the Software results from accident, abuse, negligence, misapplication, or failure to use the Software in 
accordance with the Documentation. Any replacement Software will be warranted to the original licensee for the remainder of the 
original warranty period, or thirty (30) days, whichever is longer. EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED EXPRESSLY IN THIS LIMITED WARRANTY, ALL 
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND WARRANTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF 
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, NON-INTERFERENCE, ACCURACY OF INFORMATIONAL 
CONTENT, OR ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING, LAW, USAGE, OR TRADE PRACTICE, ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE 
LAW AND ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED BY LSI, ITS SUPPLIERS AND LICENSORS. TO THE EXTENT AN IMPLIED WARRANTY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, SUCH 
WARRANTY IS LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE EXPRESS WARRANTY PERIOD. BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW 
LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY. THIS WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY ALSO 
HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. This disclaimer and exclusion shall apply even if the express warranty 
set forth above fails of its essential purpose.

4. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND REMEDIES 
IN NO EVENT SHALL LSI OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES 
ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR DOCUMENTATION (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGE FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS 
PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, LOSS OF GOODWILL, OR OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS), WHETHER RESULTING FROM LSI'S 
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF LSI WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. LSI'S MAXIMUM LIABILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING 
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION WILL NOT EXCEED AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE LICENSE FEES YOU PAID TO LSI 
FOR THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION. THE LAWS OF SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, AND THE ABOVE 
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 

5. U.S. Government End User Purchasers 
The Software and Documentation qualify as "commercial items," as that term is defined at Federal Acquisition Regulation ("FAR") 
(48 C.F.R.) 2.101, consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used 
in FAR 12.212. Consistent with FAR 12.212 and DoD FAR Supp. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, and notwithstanding any other FAR or other 
contractual clause to the contrary, you may provide to Government end user or, if this Agreement is direct, Government end user will 
acquire, the Software and Documentation with only those rights set forth in this Agreement. Use of either the Software or Documentation 
or both constitutes agreement by the Government that the Software and Documentation are "commercial computer software" and "commercial 
computer software documentation," and constitutes acceptance of the rights and restrictions herein. 

6. Term And Termination 
You may terminate this Agreement at any time, and it will automatically terminate if you fail to comply with it. If terminated, you must 
immediately destroy the Documentation and the Software and all copies you have made. 

7. Audit Rights 
LSI shall have the right on reasonable notice, at its own cost and no more than once per year, directly or through its independent 
auditors, to inspect, examine, take extracts, and make copies from, your records to the extent reasonably necessary to verify your 
compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. This right shall apply during the term of this Agreement and for one (1) 
year thereafter. 

8. Export

complete agreement between you and LSI (and that any verbal or written statements that are not reflected in this Agreement and any prior 
agreements, are superseded by this Agreement). To be effective, any amendment of this Agreement must be in writing and signed by both you

and shall not affect the remainder of the Agreement. This Agreement shall be governed by California law, not including its choice of law 
provisions. The United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods shall not be applied to this Agreement. All rights in the 
Software and Documentation not specifically granted in this Agreement are reserved by LSI or its licensors. The English language version
