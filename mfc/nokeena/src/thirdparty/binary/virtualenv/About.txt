virtualenv - Virtual Python Environment
(MFC is using the virtualenv for the "dpi-analyzer" feature.)

This requires Python 2.7 to be installed.
The file here python2.7.tar (which is Python 2.7.6) has the needed
python run-time files for installing in the normal locations, but in
a way to not change the standard Python 2.6 installation.

The instructions for building Python 2.7 is on the wiki page:

A virtual env is used for the dpi-anaylzer feature.
The virtual env was created using the following script way for use for the dpi-anaylzer feature:

  cd /opt
  virtualenv dpi-analyzer
  cd dpi-analyzer
  source bin/activate
  pip install git+https://github.com/MrRagga-/ncclient.git
  pip install junos-eznc
  deactivate 
  cd ..
  tar -zcf dpi-analyzer.tgz dpi-analyzer

This contains the following sub-directories
    bin
    include
    lib 

This tgz file is to be extracted under /opt in the MFC environment.
Important: It must be in the same full path as it was created in!
The Juniper written code to be under /opt/dpi-analyzer/scripts/.
