These have a one line fix in file atacmds.cpp (original is saved as atacmd.cpp.orig).
To make the 64 bit version:
  ./configure && make
To make the 32 bit version:
  CC="gcc -m32" CXX="g++ -m32 " ./configure && make
This make creates the file "smartctl" in the same directory.
Binaries checked in:
64bit: svn:/nkn/appliance/trunk/nokeena/src/thirdparty/binary/smartctl/smartctl
32bit: svn:/nkn/appliance/trunk/nokeena/src/thirdparty/binary/smartctl/smartctl.32

To see what version a binary is and if 32 bit or 64 bit, use the "--version"
command line parameter.

This tool is a part of the Samara CentOS platform, if we define
   PROD_FEATURE_SMARTD=1 in mk/customer.mk then
smartmontools-5.36-4.el5.x86_64.rpm gets installed. But we need the most
recent version to get support for Megaraid disk controllers, which is not
yet been picked up by CentOS, so we build it ourselves.
Plus we want to have a 32 bit binary for use during manufacturing.
