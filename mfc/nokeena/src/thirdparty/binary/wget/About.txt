wget rev 1.13.4 was released September 2011.
The MFC crawler application requires a wget version of 1.13.4 or above which
is why we use this version.

The source is modified with a patch.

The original source was downloaded this way:
  wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/wget/wget-1.13.4.tar.gz
The unmodified source is in this MFC source tree
  dist/thirdparty-src/wget/wget-1.13.4.tar.gz

wget is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 (GPLv3).
The licensing and other information for wget is available at
http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/

We have a source patch to change the functionality so wget treats https
requests as http requests.  All we use is the wget binary.

To generate the wget binary, the patch, wget-1.13.4.nkn.patch, was applied
to original source and a build was done by hand.

Steps to create the binary:
1. Untar wget-1.13.4.tar.gz
2. Copy the patch file to the wget-1.13.4/src directory.
2. Cd into the src directory and apply the patch
    cd wget-1.13.4/src
    patch -p2 -i wget-1.13.4.nkn.patch
3. Cd back to where the configure.ac file is, and
   configure and build the software:
    cd ..
    ./configure --without-ssl
    make
4. The built binary file we need is:
     src/wget

This binary was put in the MFC source tree as
  nokeena/src/thirdparty/binary/wget/wget
The Makefile in that directory installs the wget binary on the
  target machine in /opt/nkn/bin/.
