0: In the archive location /data/archive/thirdparty/src/ffmpeg/
1: Downloaded the source from the ffmpeg.org Subersion server:
     svn checkout svn://svn.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg/trunk .
   This checked out revision 126402.
2: Removed the .svn directories and put the downloaded tree into the subdir
   "ffmpeg-r26402" and create the source archive ffmpeg-r26402.tgz from it.
3: Copy ffmpeg-r26402.tgz (and the LICENSE and COPYING* files from it) to
   the MFC SVN repository in dist/thirdparty-src/ffmpeg/
4: Configured and built on the build machine:
   ./configure --enable-static --disable-shared --enable-libx264 --enable-gpl --enable-pthreads --disable-indevs --disable-outdevs
   make
5: Copy the binary "ffmpeg" to the MFC SVN tree:
     nokeena/src/thirdparty/binary/ffmpeg/
6: Copy the "ffpresets/*" files there as well.
7: The Makefile installs the binary as "/opt/nkn/bin/ffmpeg" and the
   ffpresets files into the /opt/nkn/bin/ffpresets/ directory.

FFMPEG is under LGPL license.
It also uses the libx264 library which is GPL.
Thus we need to provide the source to all customers that want it.

  FFmpeg License

    FFmpeg is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version
    2.1 or later.
    Here is a short list of things you need to take into consideration when you
    incorporate FFmpeg into proprietary programs. This list is not exhaustive, it
    just lists the most common issues we encounter.
    
        * Be careful if you enable GPL components.
        * Provide the license text, the correct version.
        * Provide FFmpeg sources, the exact version you use.
          The code must compile and you should note which revision it is and what
          options you used for* building your binary.
        * Review your EULA terms. They have to be compatible with the license of FFmpeg.
          For example, terms forbidding reverse engineering are not acceptable.
        * Read the LGPL license text, multiple times, and educate yourself about its effects.
