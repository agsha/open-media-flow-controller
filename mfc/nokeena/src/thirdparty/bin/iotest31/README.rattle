DISCLAIMER!!!!!!
THIS IS A READ/WRITE TEST.  IT SHOULD ONLY BE USED BY A
RESPONSIBLE ADULT.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!!


1. Installation....

unpack the tarfile
#tar xvf rattle.tar

Build the program..
#make rattle

or, compile by hand.
#gcc -o rattle rattle.c


2. Rattle is a read/write exerciser that will test raw, file
structured, or logical volumes. 
You must setup a data file in the following format.

/dev/rdsk/c1t1d0s2  80 2
/dev/rdsk/c1t0d0s2  60 1
/ss2usr/mail/xxx 50 1


Each line must have the device name to test, the read/write percentage,
and the number of processes to run on that device.  In this case,
/dev/rdsk/c1t1d0s2 will be tested.  80% of the IO's will be reads, and
two processes will be run.  To test in read-only mode, set the 
read/write percentage to 100.  Any read/write percentage less than 100
will enable writing. "xxx" is a file on the nfs mounted
"/ss2usr/mail/" file system.

When you start the test, you will be asked for the name of the data
file.  The devices are opened, and sized up to 2**31-1 bytes.  If you
have enabled writing on any device, you will be asked if you want to
continue.
To terminate the test, type ^C.

You can run the test detached in the following manner:
#rattle datafile &
#

WARNING!!!!  In detached mode, rattle does not ask if you want to
proceed if writing is enabled!  You have been warned!!

Do a 'ps' to identify the detached processes.  The detached processes
will run forever, or until killed, whichever comes first......
