#  About this version of ngrep  #
#################################
We wanted a version of ngrep modified in order to measure the MFC throughput.
We started with ngrep-1.45 from sourceforge.net. 
The modification is made with the patch file "juniper-ngrep.patch" applied to the ngrep-1.45 source.
The changes are to the two files ngrep.c and ngrep.h
The original version of these files are kept as ngrep.c.original and ngrep.h.original
