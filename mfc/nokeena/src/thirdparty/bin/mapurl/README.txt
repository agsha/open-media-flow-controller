Translate an ascii based URL allow/deny file format into a binary 
representation which is consumed by nvsd.
The current implementation only supports a Juniper defined format called "url".
In the future, we expect to support the IWF and CALEA URL file formats which 
will be incorporated using third party code either in source or binary form.
