Build and install this on the build machine with the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-ares=/usr/local
 make
 sudo make install

This installs on the build machine:

/usr/local/lib/libcurl.so.4.2.0
/usr/local/lib/libcurl.la
/usr/local/lib/libcurl.a
/usr/local/include/curl/curl.h
/usr/local/include/curl/curlver.h
/usr/local/include/curl/easy.h
/usr/local/include/curl/mprintf.h
/usr/local/include/curl/stdcheaders.h

/usr/local/include/curl/curlrules.h
/usr/local/share/man/man3/*
/usr/local/share/man/man1/*
/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/libcurl.pc

Use: The shared library is installed on the MFC machine, none of the other files.

libcurl.so.4.2.0
libcurl.so.4 -> libcurl.so.4.2.0
libcurl.so -> libcurl.so.4.2.0

Note that curl depends on c-ares being installed on the build machine. (c-ares is the library libcurl uses for asynchronous name resolves.)
