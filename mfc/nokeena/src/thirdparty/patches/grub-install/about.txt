There are two problems:
1: It fails to properly deal with /dev/sdp and /dev/sdp<number>.
2: It fails to properly deal with /dev/sd device names that are after
   the 26th one "/dev/sdz".
   The one after that is /dev/sdaa, then /dev/sdab, and so on.
This patch fixes the parsing of /dev/sdp* and adds support for the
longer /dev/sd<letter><letter> device names.
