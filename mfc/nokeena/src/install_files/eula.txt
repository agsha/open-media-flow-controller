READ THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT ("AGREEMENT") BEFORE DOWNLOADING, 
INSTALLING, OR USING THE SOFTWARE.  BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR USING THE 
SOFTWARE OR OTHERWISE EXPRESSING YOUR AGREEMENT TO THE TERMS CONTAINED HEREIN, 
YOU (AS CUSTOMER OR IF YOU ARE NOT THE CUSTOMER, AS A REPRESENTATIVE/AGENT 
AUTHORIZED TO BIND THE CUSTOMER) CONSENT TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT.  IF YOU 
DO NOT OR CANNOT AGREE TO THE TERMS CONTAINED HEREIN, THEN (A) DO NOT DOWNLOAD, 
INSTALL, OR USE THE SOFTWARE, AND (B) YOU MAY CONTACT JUNIPER NETWORKS 
REGARDING LICENSE TERMS.  
1.	 The Parties.  The parties to this Agreement are (i) Juniper Networks, 
Inc. (if the Customer's principal office is located in the Americas) or Juniper 
Networks (Cayman) Limited (if the Customer's principal office is located 
outside the Americas) (such applicable entity being referred to herein as 
"Juniper"), and (ii) the person or organization that originally purchased from 
Juniper or an authorized Juniper reseller the applicable license(s) for use of 
the Software ("Customer") (collectively, the "Parties").  
2.	 The Software.  In this Agreement, "Software" means the program modules 
and features of the Juniper or Juniper-supplied software, for which Customer 
has paid the applicable license or support fees to Juniper or an authorized 
Juniper reseller, or which was embedded by Juniper in equipment which Customer 
purchased from Juniper or an authorized Juniper reseller. "Software" also 
includes updates, upgrades and new releases of such software.  "Embedded 
Software" means Software which Juniper has embedded in or loaded onto the 
Juniper equipment and any updates, upgrades, additions or replacements which 
are subsequently embedded in or loaded onto the equipment.
3.	 License Grant.  Subject to payment of the applicable fees and the 
limitations and restrictions set forth herein, Juniper grants to Customer a 
non-exclusive and non-transferable license, without right to sublicense, to use 
the Software, in executable form only, subject to the following use 
restrictions:
a.	 Customer shall use Embedded Software solely as embedded in, and for 
execution on, Juniper equipment originally purchased by Customer from Juniper 
or an authorized Juniper reseller.
b.	 Customer shall use the Software on a single hardware chassis having a 
single processing unit, or as many chassis or processing units for which 
Customer has paid the applicable license fees; provided, however, with respect 
to the Steel-Belted Radius or Odyssey Access Client software only, Customer 
shall use such Software on a single computer containing a single physical 
random access memory space and containing any number of processors. Use of the 
Steel-Belted Radius or IMS AAA software on multiple computers or virtual 
machines (e.g., Solaris zones) requires multiple licenses, regardless of 
whether such computers or virtualizations are physically contained on a single 
chassis.  
c.	 Product purchase documents, paper or electronic user documentation, 
and/or the particular licenses purchased by Customer may specify limits to 
Customer's use of the Software.  Such limits may restrict use to a maximum 
number of seats, registered endpoints, concurrent users, sessions, calls, 
connections, subscribers, clusters, nodes, realms, devices, links, ports or 
transactions, or require the purchase of separate licenses to use particular 
features, functionalities, services, applications, operations, or capabilities, 
or provide throughput, performance, configuration, bandwidth, interface, 
processing, temporal, or geographical limits. In addition, such limits may 
restrict the use of the Software to managing certain kinds of networks or 
require the Software to be used only in conjunction with other specific 
Software. Customer's use of the Software shall be subject to all such 
limitations and purchase of all applicable licenses.    
d.	 For any trial copy of the Software, Customer's right to use the 
Software expires 30 days after download, installation or use of the Software.  
Customer may operate the Software after the 30-day trial period only if 
Customer pays for a license to do so.  Customer may not extend or create an 
additional trial period by re-installing the Software after the 30-day trial 
period.
e.	 The Global Enterprise Edition of the Steel-Belted Radius software may 
be used by Customer only to manage access to Customer's enterprise network.  
Specifically, service provider customers are expressly prohibited from using 
the Global Enterprise Edition of the Steel-Belted Radius software to support 
any commercial network access services. 
The foregoing license is not transferable or assignable by Customer.  No 
license is granted herein to any user who did not originally purchase the 
applicable license(s) for the Software from Juniper or an authorized Juniper 
reseller.  
4.	 Use Prohibitions.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the license provided 
herein does not permit the Customer to, and Customer agrees not to and shall 
not: (a) modify, unbundle, reverse engineer, or create derivative works based 
on the Software; (b) make unauthorized copies of the Software (except as 
necessary for backup purposes); (c) rent, sell, transfer, or grant any rights 
in and to any copy of the Software, in any form, to any third party; (d) remove 
any proprietary notices, labels, or marks on or in any copy of the Software or 
any product in which the Software is embedded; (e) distribute any copy of the 
Software to any third party, including as may be embedded in Juniper equipment 
sold in the secondhand market; (f) use any 'locked' or key-restricted feature, 
function, service, application, operation, or capability without first 
purchasing the applicable license(s) and obtaining a valid key from Juniper, 
even if such feature, function, service, application, operation, or capability 
is enabled without a key; (g) distribute any key for the Software provided by 
Juniper to any third party; (h) use the Software in any manner that extends or 
is broader than the uses purchased by Customer from Juniper or an authorized 
Juniper reseller; (i) use Embedded Software on non-Juniper equipment; (j) use  
Embedded Software (or make it available for use) on Juniper equipment that the 
Customer did not originally purchase from Juniper or an authorized Juniper 
reseller; (k) disclose the results of testing or benchmarking of the Software 
to any third party without the prior written consent of Juniper; or (l) use the 
Software in any manner other than as expressly provided herein.
5.	 Audit.  Customer shall maintain accurate records as necessary to 
verify compliance with this Agreement.  Upon request by Juniper, Customer shall 
furnish such records to Juniper and certify its compliance with this Agreement.
6.	 Confidentiality.  The Parties agree that aspects of the Software and 
associated documentation are the confidential property of Juniper.  As such, 
Customer shall exercise all reasonable commercial efforts to maintain the 
Software and associated documentation in confidence, which at a minimum 
includes restricting access to the Software to Customer employees and 
contractors having a need to use the Software for Customer's internal business 
purposes.
7.	 Ownership.  Juniper and Juniper's licensors, respectively, retain 
ownership of all right, title, and interest (including copyright) in and to the 
Software, associated documentation, and all copies of the Software.  Nothing in 
this Agreement constitutes a transfer or conveyance of any right, title, or 
interest in the Software or associated documentation, or a sale of the 
Software, associated documentation, or copies of the Software.  
8.	 Warranty, Limitation of Liability, Disclaimer of Warranty.  The 
warranty applicable to the Software shall be as set forth in the warranty 
statement that accompanies the Software (the "Warranty Statement").  Nothing in 
this Agreement shall give rise to any obligation to support the Software.  
Support services may be purchased separately.  Any such support shall be 
governed by a separate, written support services agreement.  TO THE MAXIMUM 
EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, JUNIPER SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOSS 
OF DATA, OR COSTS OR PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR FOR ANY 
SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE 
SOFTWARE, OR ANY JUNIPER OR JUNIPER-SUPPLIED SOFTWARE.  IN NO EVENT SHALL 
JUNIPER BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM UNAUTHORIZED OR IMPROPER USE OF ANY 
JUNIPER OR JUNIPER-SUPPLIED SOFTWARE.  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THE 
WARRANTY STATEMENT TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, JUNIPER DISCLAIMS ANY AND 
ALL WARRANTIES IN AND TO THE SOFTWARE (WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR 
OTHERWISE), INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT.  IN NO EVENT DOES JUNIPER WARRANT THAT 
THE SOFTWARE, OR ANY EQUIPMENT OR NETWORK RUNNING THE SOFTWARE, WILL OPERATE 
WITHOUT ERROR OR INTERRUPTION, OR WILL BE FREE OF VULNERABILITY TO INTRUSION OR 
ATTACK.  In no event shall Juniper's or its suppliers' or licensors' liability 
to Customer, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of 
warranty, or otherwise, exceed the price paid by Customer for the Software that 
gave rise to the claim, or if the Software is embedded in another Juniper 
product, the price paid by Customer for such other product.  Customer 
acknowledges and agrees that Juniper has set its prices and entered into this 
Agreement in reliance upon the disclaimers of warranty and the limitations of 
liability set forth herein, that the same reflect an allocation of risk between 
the Parties (including the risk that a contract remedy may fail of its 
essential purpose and cause consequential loss), and that the same form an 
essential basis of the bargain between the Parties.
9.	 Termination.  Any breach of this Agreement or failure by Customer to 
pay any applicable fees due shall result in automatic termination of the 
license granted herein.  Upon such termination, Customer shall destroy or 
return to Juniper all copies of the Software and related documentation in 
Customer's possession or control.  
10.	 Taxes.  All license fees payable under this agreement are exclusive of 
tax.   Customer shall be responsible for paying Taxes arising from the purchase 
of the license, or importation or use of the Software.  If applicable, valid 
exemption documentation for each taxing jurisdiction shall be provided to 
Juniper prior to invoicing, and Customer shall promptly notify Juniper if their 
exemption is revoked or modified.  All payments made by Customer shall be net 
of any applicable withholding tax.   Customer will provide reasonable 
assistance to Juniper in connection with such withholding taxes by promptly: 
providing Juniper with valid tax receipts and other required documentation 
showing Customer's payment of any withholding taxes; completing appropriate 
applications that would reduce the amount of withholding tax to be paid; and 
notifying and assisting Juniper in any audit or tax proceeding related to 
transactions hereunder.  Customer shall comply with all applicable tax laws and 
regulations, and Customer will promptly pay or reimburse Juniper for all costs 
and damages related to any liability incurred by Juniper as a result of 
Customer's non-compliance or delay with its responsibilities herein.  
Customer's obligations under this Section shall survive termination or 
expiration of this Agreement.  
11.	 Export.  Customer agrees to comply with all applicable export laws and 
restrictions and regulations of any United States and any applicable foreign 
agency or authority, and not to export or re-export the Software or any direct 
product thereof in violation of any such restrictions, laws or regulations, or 
without all necessary approvals.  Customer shall be liable for any such 
violations.  The version of the Software supplied to Customer may contain 
encryption or other capabilities restricting Customer's ability to export the 
Software without an export license.  
12.	 Commercial Computer Software.  The Software is "commercial computer 
software" and is provided with restricted rights.  Use, duplication, or 
disclosure by the United States government is subject to restrictions set forth 
in this Agreement and as provided in DFARS 227.7201 through 227.7202-4, FAR 
12.212, FAR 27.405(b)(2), FAR 52.227-19, or FAR 52.227-14(ALT III) as 
applicable.
13.	 Interface Information. To the extent required by applicable law, and 
at Customer's written request, Juniper shall provide Customer with the 
interface information needed to achieve interoperability between the Software 
and another independently created program, on payment of applicable fee, if 
any. Customer shall observe strict obligations of confidentiality with respect 
to such information and shall use such information in compliance with any 
applicable terms and conditions upon which Juniper makes such information 
available.
14.	 Third Party Software.  Any licensor of Juniper whose software is 
embedded in the Software and any supplier of Juniper whose products or 
technology are embedded in (or services are accessed by) the Software shall be 
a third party beneficiary with respect to this Agreement, and such licensor or 
vendor shall have the right to enforce this Agreement in its own name as if it 
were Juniper. In addition, certain third party software may be provided with 
the Software and is subject to the accompanying license(s), if any, of its 
respective owner(s).  To the extent portions of the Software are distributed 
under and subject to open source licenses obligating Juniper to make the source 
code for such portions publicly available (such as the GNU General Public 
License ("GPL") or the GNU Library General Public License ("LGPL")), Juniper 
will make such source code portions (including Juniper modifications, as 
appropriate) available upon request for a period of up to three years from the 
date of distribution.  Such request can be made in writing to Juniper Networks, 
Inc., 1194 N. Mathilda Ave., Sunnyvale, CA  94089, ATTN:  General Counsel.  You 
may obtain a copy of the GPL at http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html, and a 
copy of the LGPL at http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html.  
15.	 Miscellaneous.  This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the 
State of California without reference to its conflicts of laws principles.  The 
provisions of the U.N. Convention for the International Sale of Goods shall not 
apply to this Agreement. For any disputes arising under this Agreement, the 
Parties hereby consent to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of, and venue 
in, the state and federal courts within Santa Clara County, California.  This 
Agreement constitutes the entire and sole agreement between Juniper and the 
Customer with respect to the Software, and supersedes all prior and 
contemporaneous agreements relating to the Software, whether oral or written 
(including any inconsistent terms contained in a purchase order), except that 
the terms of a separate written agreement executed by an authorized Juniper 
representative and Customer shall govern to the extent such terms are 
inconsistent or conflict with terms contained herein.  No modification to this 
Agreement nor any waiver of any rights hereunder shall be effective unless 
expressly assented to in writing by the party to be charged.  If any portion of 
this Agreement is held invalid, the Parties agree that such invalidity shall 
not affect the validity of the remainder of this Agreement.  This Agreement and 
associated documentation has been written in the English language, and the 
Parties agree that the English version will govern. (For Canada: Les parties 
aux présentés confirment leur volonté que cette convention de même que tous les 
documents y compris tout avis qui s'y rattaché, soient redigés en langue 
anglaise. (Translation: The parties confirm that this Agreement and all related 
documentation is and will be in the English language)).
