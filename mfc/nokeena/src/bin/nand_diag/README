Compile:
-------
cc -o ndiag -g nand_diag.c

Usage:
-----
./ndiag -d <device name> -b <disk block size in bytes>
	-p <disk page size in bytes> -s <start block> -n <number of blocks>
	-m <test mode> -o <log file>

    <device name> - the device path
    <block size> - size of the block to be used in bytes
    <page size> - size of the page to be used in bytes
    <start block> - the block number to start with
    <number of blocks> - number of blocks to test
    <test mode> - one of the following tests (0 - 4)
	        0: SEQ_FIXED - Write/Read a fixed pattern sequentially
		1: SEQ_RANDOM - Write address as data sequentially,
				Verify all blocks.
				Write the inverse of address as data
					sequentially, Verify all blocks.
		2: SEQ_RANDOM_1PASS - Write address as data sequentially,
				Verify all blocks
		3: RAN_FIXED - Write/Read address as data sequentially;
		4: RAN_RANDOM - Write address as data on random blocks and
				then verify all the blocks
    <log file> - path of the file to write errors
