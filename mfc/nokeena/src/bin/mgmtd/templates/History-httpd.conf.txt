# The first httpd.conf file checked in here (6120) was based on
# the Samara Elm Update 5 version (rev 110) with two added lines
# after the SSLOptions line:
#   SSLProtocol -all +SSLv3 +TLSv1
#   SSLCipherSuite SSLv3:+HIGH:+MEDIUM
# Note:
#  The samara EucU2 added the SSLProtocl line as above
#  and added the SSLCiperSuite line that we later updated to match
#  in the seventh change.

# The second change (6122) was to add "TraceEnable off" in the
# secion <VirtualHost _default_:@HttpsPort@>
# (This addition has never been made to the TallMaple version)

# The third change (9930) added five lines to add a new virtual host section:
#  Listen                127.0.0.1:8081
#  ...
#  NameVirtualHost 127.0.0.1:8081
#  <VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:8081>
#  
#  </VirtualHost>

# The fourth change (11070) removed the five lines added in the third change.

# The fifth change (18486) added two things:
# 1: Access to /nkn/ftphome with these added lines:
#  <Directory "/nkn/ftphome/*_ftpuser/">
#      Options FollowSymLinks
#      AllowOverride None
#      Order Allow,Deny
#      Allow from all
#  </Directory>
#  
# 2: A new virtual host with these nine added lines:
#  Listen 127.0.0.1:8080
#  ... 
#  NameVirtualHost 127.0.0.1:8080
#  
#  <VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:8080>
#      SetENV force-no-vary 1
#      RewriteEngine on
#      RewriteCond %{HTTP:X-Namespace-Name} !"" [NC]
#      RewriteRule ^/(.*)$ /nkn/ftphome/%{HTTP:X-Namespace-Name}_ftpuser/$1
#  </VirtualHost>

# The sixth change (20332) removed the "Listen" line added in the fifth change.

# The seventh change (20494) changed the SSLCipherSuite line
# to match the setting in the Samara Ecualyptus Update 2 version (173).
#   -SSLCipherSuite SSLv3:+HIGH:+MEDIUM
#   +SSLCipherSuite ALL:!ADH:!aNULL:!eNULL:!LOW:!EXP:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM
# except the order is different in the EucU2 version:
#    SSLCipherSuite ALL:!aNULL:!ADH:!eNULL:!LOW:!EXP:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM
# I don't think that this makes any difference.

# The eight change deleted the file to clear the deck to better integrate
# the changes that have been being made to httpd.conf in the Samara source.

# So the only real things we have changed that are not in the Samara version
# of this file are the second change, and the fifth and sixth changes.

# So with the ninth change I am putting in a copy of the httpd.conf file
# from Samara Fir without any of our changes, and have the next change
# will be adding our changes (2nd, 5th, 6th) back in.
