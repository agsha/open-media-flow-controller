READ-ONLY NFS
-------------
This document describes the READ-ONLY NFS configuration. 

URI to NFS mount mapping
========================
1. Configuration:
        a. Namespace to mount point mapping: A namespace, also contained in the
           incoming URI, is mapped to the following:
                - IP address of NFS server.
                - Directory in the NFS server.
	b. Namespace protocol:
		- The namespace has a 'proto' field which will be NFS or HTTP.
		  In this case, it is NFS. 

2. Mount:
        a. When a namspace is mapped to an NFS server, the NFSM assigns/mounts
           a new mount point to the tuple <ip-address, nfs server>.
        b. The mapping between this mount point and the namespace is put is 
	   stored.

3. Temporary configuration
 	a. This will be the temporary way to use NFS provider. 
	b. In the target machine, there is a configfile: /nkn/nknconfig.txt
	c. Format: <prefix> <ip-address> <mountdir>
	d. Look for example in: 172.19.172.14:/nkn/nfsconfig.txt
	e. Eg: www.yahoo.com 172.19.172.50 /home/vikram/tmp
	f. You can configure multiple mount points like this and nvsd will automatically mount
	   these directories. 
	g. Example wget from a client machine: wget http://172.19.172.14/home/vikram/tmp/vikram.flv

NFS_stat
======
1. URI to namespace mapping:
	a. The uri contains the key to the namespace. Partially compare the 
	   uriname to the namespace name to get the mount point for the 
	   content of the uri. 
	b. The filename of the content of the uri is returned with the MM_stat.

2. Uri-object-length
	a. The URI request may be one for the whole video or just a part of it.
	b. The stat function needs to hand back a hint pertaining to the UOL. 

NFS_get
=====
1. Mapping:
	a. Do MM_stat to get the path/file where the URI content is stored. 

2. Output: 
	a. Divide the data into multiple chunks of 2MB each and 
	   send it back in an array of io vectors that are passed in.

2. Uri-object-length
	a. The URI request may be one for the whole video or just a part of it.
	b. The get function needs to hand back only only 'length' amount of data
	   from the 'offset' in the file. 


Implementation
==============
1. Prefix to Mount point mapping database
	- An entry is inserted when a new namespace is configured.
	- An entry is deleted when the namespace is deleted or the protocol 
	  has been changed.
