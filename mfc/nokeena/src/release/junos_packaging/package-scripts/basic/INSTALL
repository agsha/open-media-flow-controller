# Installation script
#
# This script is run after the tar file has been unpacked into the /var
# playpen area and before anything has actually been moved to the final
# location, and then again after things have been moved into place.
#
# The +INSTALL script is created from these source parts:
#  1. package-scripts/script-header
#  2. package-scripts/script-func
#  3. my-script-header
#  4. This file
