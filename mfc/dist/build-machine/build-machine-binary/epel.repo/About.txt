Instructions for putting epel.repo in the YUM repo list.

NOTE: epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm and gpg key file have been already downloaded to
   /data/archive/thirdparty/build-machine-binary/epel.repo/

1. Add /etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo if it is not there. Type "yum repolist" to see if it is there. If not do the following:
(Instructions from http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/06/enable-epel-repository/)

2. Download epel rpm.
For CentOS 6, download the rpm file from http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/repoview/epel-release.html
For Example if it is http://epel.mirror.constant.com/6/i386/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm then do:

cd /tmp
wget http://epel.mirror.constant.com/6/i386/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm

or

cd /tmp/
cp /data/archive/thirdparty/build-machine-binary/epel.repo/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm .

3. - Find out the GPG key value needed by the epel package you just downloaded using the --test option. E.g.

 rpm -ivh epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm --test

That prints out warning: epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm: Header V3 RSA/SHA256 Signature, key ID 0608b895: NOKEY

4. - Get the key file that has that key ID and install it using rpm. Download the key file, or use a local copy:

wget --no-check-certificate https://www.fedoraproject.org/static/0608B895.txt

mv 0608B895.txt /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-EPEL-6

or

cp /data/archive/thirdparty/build-machine-binary/epel.repo/0608B895.txt /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-EPEL-6

Now install it

rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-EPEL-6

5. - Verify that the key got installed successfully:

rpm -qa gpg-*

This should print out for example: gpg-pubkey-0608b895-4bd22942

6. - Now install the epel rpm which will enable the EPEL repository for use by yum. (http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL)

rpm -ivh epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm

7. You might need to edit the two /etc/yum.repos.d/epel*.repo files.

    If the command yum repolist prints out and error, then:
        edit /etc/yum.repos.d/epel*.repo to switch from using mirrorlist to baseurl. 

Also note that any reference to "download.fedora.redhat.com" in any /etc/yum.repos.d/* files must be replaced with "dl.fedoraproject.org".
See http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/announce/2012-February/003040.html) 8. - Verify that the EPEL repository is enabled.

yum repolist

9. Then run "yum clean all" to make it use the new settings.

yum clean all
