The x264 library must be installed in order to compile ffmpeg.

The source came from:

It is archived at: /data/archive/thirdparty/build-machine-src/x264/x264-snapshot-20110126-2245.tar.bz2

Extract this tar file in a new temp directory and configure, build and install it.

mkdir /tmp/x286-build
cd /tmp/x286-build
bunzip2 -c  /data/archive/thirdparty/build-machine-src/x264/x264-snapshot-20110126-2245.tar.bz2 | tar xvf -
cd x264-snapshot-20110126-2245
./configure
make
make install

Note that the license is GPL. The ffmpeg binary is linked with this so it gets infected with GPL.
