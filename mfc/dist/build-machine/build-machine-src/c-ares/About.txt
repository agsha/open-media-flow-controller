c-ares is a C library that performs DNS requests and name resolves asynchronously.

Note that "curl" depends on c-ares being installed on the build machine.

Download from http://c-ares.haxx.se/
Use the version that is on all the other build machines, or if there is a new version and the developers agree, then update all the build machines. It is important for all the build machines to have the same version.
The latest version is 1.10.0 released 12-may-2013.  (as of 2015-07)
We have been using 1.7.1 from http://c-ares.haxx.se/download/c-ares-1.7.1.tar.gz  (23-mar-2010)

This is in the MFC source tree as:
  dist/build-machine/build-machine-src/c-ares/c-ares-1.7.1.tar.gz 
There is a copy of this on storage01:
  /data/archive/thirdparty/build-machine-src/c-ares-1.7.1.tar.gz

Built this way:
Untar c-ares-1.7.1.tar.gz into a temporary directory.
Create the directory /tmp/ca-src and extract the tar into it like this: 

T=c-ares-1.7.1
FROM=/data/archive/thirdparty/build-machine-src/c-ares
rm -rf /tmp/ca-src
mkdir /tmp/ca-src
cd /tmp/ca-src
tar zxvf ${FROM}/${T}.tar.gz

    Build and install with these commands (as root) 

cd /tmp/ca-src/c*
find * -type f | sort > BEFORE_CONFIGURE.LIST
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
find * -type f | sort > BEFORE_MAKE.LIST
make
find * -type f | sort > AFTER_MAKE.LIST
find /usr/local -type f | sort > BEFORE_INSTALL.LIST
make install
find /usr/local -type f | sort > AFTER_INSTALL.LIST
diff BEFORE_INSTALL.LIST AFTER_INSTALL.LIST
D=/root/`uname -n`
mkdir ${D}/c-ares-install
cp *.LIST ${D}/c-ares-install/
