Patches for glib2-2.22.5-7.el6.src.rpm

Patch 1: glib2-2.22.5-jnpr-2013-stacksize.patch
This patch adds two functions g_hash_table_foreach_remove_n()
and g_thread_pool_set_default_stack_size().  These are used to control
the default stack size. (To fix the "gthread stack size" problem.)

Patch 2: glib2-2.22.5-jnpr-2015-chainhash.patch
This patch changes the hash table logic from open addressing to chained addressing. 

Note-- Changes from earlier versions--
1. glib2-2.22.5-jnpr-2013-mfc.patch was renamed to
   glib2-2.22.5-jnpr-2013-stacksize.patch to make it descriptive.
   Only the filename was changed, no change to the patch itself.
2. glib2-2.22.5-jnpr-2013-chainhash.patch was replaced with a better patch
   glib2-2.22.5-jnpr-2015-chainhash.patch.  The 2013 one needlessly moved
   functions around and made other non-functional changes that made it both
   very hard to see just what the effective changes were and made it impossible
   to update the patcha to newer version of glib2.
